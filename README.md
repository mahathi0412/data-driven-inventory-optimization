**Data-Driven Inventory Optimization**
This project aims to optimize inventory levels using predictive analytics. By analyzing historical sales and inventory data, we develop a predictive model to forecast future inventory needs, thereby reducing holding costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

**Introduction**
Inventory management is a critical aspect of supply chain operations. Efficient inventory management ensures that products are available to meet customer demand without overstocking, which can lead to increased holding costs. This project uses historical inventory data to develop a predictive model for optimizing inventory levels.

**DATA DESCRIPTION**
The dataset used in this project is the Online Retail dataset, which contains transactional data for a UK-based online retail store from December 2010 to December 2011. The data includes the following columns:
- InvoiceNo: Invoice number (unique for each transaction)
- StockCode: Product code
- Description: Product description
- Quantity: Quantity of the product purchased
- InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
- UnitPrice: Unit price of the product
- CustomerID: Customer number (unique for each customer)
- Country: Country of the customer

**METHODOLOGY**

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Load and preprocess the data.
- Handle missing values and convert the InvoiceDate column to datetime format.
- Aggregate data every month to get monthly inventory levels.

**Stationarity Check:**
- Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity.
- Apply differencing if the data is not stationary.

**ARIMA Model:**
- Develop an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast future inventory needs.
- Train the model on the historical data.
- Generate forecasts for the next 12 months.

**ARIMA**
**What is ARIMA?**
ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a class of models that explains a given time series based on its own past values, its own past errors (moving averages), and a differencing term to make the series stationary. ARIMA models are widely used for forecasting and are suitable for univariate time series data.

**Why ARIMA?**
ARIMA was chosen for this project due to the following reasons:

**Handling of Temporal Dependencies:**
- ARIMA models are effective in capturing the temporal dependencies in the time series data, which is crucial for accurate forecasting of inventory levels.
**Stationarity Adjustment:**
- The 'Integrated' part of ARIMA handles non-stationarity in the data by applying differencing, which is essential for modelling real-world time series data that often exhibit trends and seasonality.
**Flexibility:**
- ARIMA models can accommodate various types of time series patterns through its parameters:
    p: The number of lag observations included in the model (autoregressive part).
    d: The number of times that the raw observations are differenced (integrated part).
    q: The size of the moving average window (moving average part).
  
**Model Implementation:**
**Data Preparation:** The data is preprocessed to ensure stationary by using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and applying differencing if necessary.
**Parameter Selection:** The ARIMA model parameters are selected based on the characteristics of the time series data.
**Model Training:** The ARIMA model is trained on the historical data to learn the underlying patterns and trends.
**Forecasting:** The trained model forecasts future inventory levels, providing insights into future stock needs.

**Results Visualization:**
- Plot the observed and forecasted inventory levels.
- Provide confidence intervals for the forecasts.

**RESULTS**
The ARIMA model was trained on the historical inventory data and used to forecast inventory levels for the next 12 months. The forecasted values, along with the observed data, are plotted to visualize the trends and future predictions. The model provides a reliable forecast with confidence intervals to aid in decision-making for inventory management.

**CONCLUSION**
The predictive model developed in this project helps optimize inventory levels by forecasting future needs based on historical data. This approach can significantly reduce holding costs and improve supply chain efficiency. The methodology and results demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven decision-making in inventory management.
